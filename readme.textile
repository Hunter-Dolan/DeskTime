h2. Notes

p. This app was my first mac application. It was originally planned to be a paid app, but I don't have the time to continue working on it, so I've open sourced it so it can live on forever.
p. Please note: This is in the EOL (End of Life) stage of development. I will no longer support it.

h2. Original Description

**DeskTime is a Mac users dream!**

p. For years I have loved changing up my wallpaper. But what if you could have a different wallpaper for ever part of the day. Have one in the morning, one in the afternoon, & one at night. With DeskTime that dream can now be a reality. DeskTime is a lightweight background service that will change your preset wallpaper depending on the time of the day. Right now you can only have 3 wallpapers but we plan to allow users to define custom Times & Dates.
